# Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby
### A book by Sandi Metz

This repository is a collection of the notes I take and the exercises I code, copy and develop while reading POODR.

There is a folder for each chapter with a MAIN markdown file with the notes and multiple Ruby scripts corresponding to the exercises and examples.
