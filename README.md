# Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby
### A book by Sandi Metz

This repository is a collection of the notes I take and the exercises I code, copy and develop while reading POODR.

There is a folder for each chapter with a MAIN markdown file with the notes and multiple Ruby scripts corresponding to the exercises and examples.

POODR is one of the best materials I've read regarding object oriented design and it will help you to model better object-oriented applications in Ruby or in any other OO language.

You should go and [buy the book](http://www.poodr.com/)
